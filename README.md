# data_structures-portfolioproj
<br>Course: Data Structures
<br>Language: Python 3.8
<br>Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio Code

## Introduction
The course taught data structures and abstract data types including Dyanmic Arrays, Bags, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Deques, Trees, Binary Trees, AVL Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables and introduced Graphs, Big-O complexity, and amortized analysis. The course culminated in this final project to tie in multiple data structures, specifically a Hash Table and a Minimum Heap, along with complexity analysis.

## Description
Implementing a Hash Table requires a Dynamic Array by itself or the addition of a LinkedList, depending on what is chosen to handle hash collisions. For this implementation, hash collision were handled with chaining, and thus utilized Linked Lists alongside the Dynamic Array. The two hash functions are relatively simple, and create enough of a spread in resulting indices to demonstrate functionality.



## Instructions
